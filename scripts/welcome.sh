# SessionStart (startup) hook: introduce hyperui once per project.
# Resolves the project root(s) with profile.sh (cwd, or the repo(s) remembered for this
# directory via `/hyperui --repo <path>`), then prints the full intro as SessionStart
# additionalContext when <root>/.hyperui/ is missing; when it exists, prints one routing line so
# bare requests ("what can you do?", "where do I start?", product work) still reach the hyperui
# skill instead of generic Claude Code help. When this directory works on another repo, says so.
# Also runs scripts/update-check.sh (24 h cache) and, when a newer hyperui exists that the user
# has not declined, appends a one-line update offer to the context. Also fires
# scripts/telemetry.sh flush in the background (opt-in telemetry: no-op without consent, daily
# POST otherwise, 3 s curl, silent) so it never delays the session.
